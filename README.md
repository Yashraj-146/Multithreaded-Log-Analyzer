# Multithreaded Log Analyzer (C++17)

A high-performance, multithreaded C++17 tool for parsing and analyzing large server/network log files.

## Features
- Parses log files and computes key metrics:
  - Total requests
  - Error rate
  - Average latency
- Multithreaded processing using a custom thread pool
- Efficient memory management with RAII
- Modular CMake-based architecture

## Build
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
## To Rebuild
cd build
make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)

## RUN
Single Thread:
./LogAnalyzer ../data/sample.log
Multithread:
./LogAnalyzer ../data/large_sample.log

## Example Output
